# **GreenEcoHub - Energy Management Platform**

Welcome to GreenEcoHub, a platform for managing renewable energy interactions and streamlining the information exchange between various stakeholders in the energy sector. This platform is designed to connect network operators, energy consultants, solar technicians, and households to foster efficient management and planning of energy resources. The administration rights and functions can be held by a third party.

## Platform Overview

GreenEcoHub provides a central hub for:

- **Administrators**: Crucial for the effective management and maintenance of the platform, administrators ensure the success of the system by utilizing comprehensive guides designed to handle complex functionalities and responsibilities.

- **Network Operators**: They benefit from streamlined contract management, billing, and real-time energy consumption monitoring with smart meter technologies, enhancing interaction with households and providing insights into network performance.

- **Energy Consultants**: Supported by the platform in issuing energy certificates and accessing relevant household data, energy consultants facilitate renewable energy solutions planning and accelerate communication among stakeholders.

- **Solar Technicians (Solarteurs)**: This user manual aids solar technicians in managing installation projects and customer interactions, focusing on the features essential for planning, executing, and tracking solar projects.

- **Households**: Equipped with tools to manage contracts and select tariffs, households can actively participate in the energy transition. The platform enhances their understanding and optimization of energy consumption through data visualization and integrates energy consultants and solar technicians to tailor renewable energy solutions to their needs.

The platform's goal is to enhance the operational efficiency of energy management and support sustainability through advanced technological solutions.
